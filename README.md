- Run `pyinstalive` to generate a default configuration file.
- Edit the configuration file using any text editor.
- Run `pyinstalive -d "<live-username>"` to start downloading a livestream or replay.

## Prerequisites

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Python 2.7.x or 3.5>=](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip + setuptools](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

Make sure all tools are accessible via command line (added to your PATH if on Windows, use Google).

## Installation

*Tip â€” To install PyInstaLive with the latest commit changes, remove the version tag from the install command (e.g. **@3.2.4**).*

#### Installing

Run the following command in your command line (might need to be run as administrator on Windows):
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/notcammy/PyInstaLive.git@3.2.4
```

#### Updating

To update PyInstaLive to the latest version (currently **3.2.4**) run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/notcammy/PyInstaLive.git@3.2.4 --upgrade
```

#### Specific versions

If you want to install a specific version of PyInstaLive when for example the newest version contains a bug, you can specify a different version tag in the install command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/notcammy/PyInstaLive.git@2.2.0
```

Use the version number you want after the **@** symbol (e.g **@2.2.0**).

## Usage

Make sure there is a configuration file called ``pyinstalive.ini`` in the directory you want to run PyInstaLive from.

PyInstaLive will automatically generate a default configuration file for you to edit if one is not present already.

Here is an example of a valid configuration file:
```ini
[pyinstalive]
username = johndoe
password = grapefruits
download_path = 
download_lives = True
download_replays = True
download_comments = true
show_cookie_expiry = True
log_to_file = True
ffmpeg_path = 
run_at_start =
run_at_finish =
use_locks = True
clear_temp_files = False
do_heartbeat = True
proxy = 
skip_merge = False
```

#### Example

```bash
pyinstalive -u "johndoe" -p "grapefruits" -d "janedoe"
```
You can omit the `username` and `password` arguments if you have specified these in the configuration file:
```bash
pyinstalive -d "janedoe"
```

Below is an example of PyInstaLive's output after downloading a livestream:

```
> pyinstalive -d "janedoe"

## Notes
- I have not much time to extensively test the changes I make to the code, so when you do encounter a problem please [open an issue](https://github.com/notcammy/PyInstaLive/issues/new) and try using an older version of PyInstaLive in the meantime.

- Python 2 cannot save most unicode characters in comments such as emojis if it's not built from source using the `--enable-unicode=ucs4` argument. Read more about this [here](https://emoji-unicode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python2.html). This should probably not affect pre-installed Python 2 installations on Linux-based systems such as Ubuntu or Debian.
